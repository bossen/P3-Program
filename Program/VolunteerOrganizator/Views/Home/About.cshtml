    <h5>Who are we?</h5><br />
    <p>
        We are a small group of students at the danish Institure of Computer Science in Aalborg. 
        The team consists of 6 software engineer students, whom are as of this writing, on their third semester.
    </p>
    <h5>What are we doing?</h5><br />
    <p>
        What we are making here, in case you haven't guessed it already, is a tool with the purpose 
        of improving and enriching volunteers' job environment with the hope of it increasing the 
        general participation levels overall in the population.

    <h5>Why are we doing this?</h5><br />
    <p>
        This webpage is part of our semesterproject for our third semester here on AAU, so we are expected to 
        deliver an IT based solution on a problem. The problem we found was that since times have changed, 
        so has the potential do-gooders. There's a larger focus on the social aspect, rather than of the 
        community itself. We don't think that's a bad thing in itself, but it creates new challenges 
        in reaching out to the young people. We address those challenges.
